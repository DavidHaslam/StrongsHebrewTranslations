# StrongsHebrewTranslations
Using **Excelâ„¢** to facilitate translating the definitions for **StrongsHebrew** to languages other than **English**

The worksheet **StrongsHebrew** was derived as follows:
1. Used Sword utility **mod2imp** to export module **StrongsHebrew** to a text file with raw IMP format
2. Copied the tab delimited text into the worksheet
3. Inserted a header row and applied **View** | **Freeze Panes** | **Freeze Top Row**
4. Selected whole sheet & applied **Conditional Formating** for empty cells to have grey fill
5. Set vertical alignment = top
6. Set all cells to have line wrap
7. Adjusted row height to automatic, thus fitting every definition within its cell & without hiding any part thereof.
8. Hide all intermediate empty columns {B, D, F, H} caused by the second tab between text fields
9. Hide all rows that are blank (except for column A which contains the $$$nnnnn = numerical entry identifiers)
10. Adjusted column widths for columns still visible: {A, C, E, G, I}
11. Hidden columns {C, E, G} leaving only columns {A, I} visible. Column I contains the **Definitions**.
12. Made column K narrower than the default (although this column is empty, it makes the next step easier)
13. Adjusted **View** | **Zoom** to fit columns A though K.
14. Set **Data** | **Filter** (facilitating displaying selected entries as & when required)

## Derived file[s]
The file <code>Definitions.English.txt</code> was made by pasting the filtered **Column I** labeled **Definition** to a Text Editor.<br/>
This is the only portion of the IMP file that requires translating.
