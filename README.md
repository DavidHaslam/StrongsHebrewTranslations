# StrongsHebrewTranslations
Using Excelâ„¢ to facilitate translating the definitions for StrongsHebrew

The worksheet **StrongsHebrew** was derived as follows:
1. Used Sword utility **mod2imp** to export module **StrongsHebrew** to a text file with raw IMP format
2. Copied the tab delimited text into the worksheet
3. Inserted a header row
4. Applied **Conditional Formating** for empty cells to have grey fill
5. Set vertical alignment = top
6. Set all cells to have line wrap
7. Hide all intermediate empty columns {B, D, F, H} caused by the second tab between text fields
8. Hide all rows that are blank (except for column A which contains the $$$nnnnn = numerical entry identifiers)
9. Adjusted column widths for columns still visible: {A, C, E, G, I}
10. Hidden columns {C, E, G} leaving only columns {A, I} visible. Column I contains the **Definitions**.
11. Made column K narrower than the default (although this column is empty, it makes the next step easier)
12. Adjusted View | Zoom to fit columns A though K.
